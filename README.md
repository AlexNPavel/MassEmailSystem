# MassEmailSystem
A system to set up mass emails using 2 text files. NOTE: There are 2 versions of code here, one for Windows ANSI (aka Windows cp1252) and the standard linux text format.
The names of the people being emailed is stored in "emails.txt" in the standard format uploaded in this repository.
The message is stored in "messages.txt". The first line is the subject, and every line after is the message. To enter the recipient's name in the message, just type "recipient_name", and the program will automatically use the information from "emails.txt" to substitute the correct name.
